## Introduction

Bike fitting has become a fundamental lever of cycling performance.

Today, fitters use sophisticated tools to analyze pedaling kinematics, optimize joint alignment, and secure efficient power transfer. These technologies have significantly improved the precision of adjustments and the biomechanical understanding of cycling posture.

Yet a major paradox remains.

👉 **Fitting allows precise positional adjustments, but it still does not objectively measure their real impact on performance.**

---

## A paradox at the heart of modern bike fitting

During a fitting session, many variables are measured with high precision: joint angles, movement amplitudes, symmetry, and pedaling force distribution.

These data help optimize posture based on solid biomechanical criteria and form the foundation of modern fitting practices.

However, they do not answer the athlete’s central question:

**“Will this position actually make me faster?”**

Because optimizing biomechanics does not necessarily mean optimizing performance.

A position may be biomechanically stable, comfortable, and efficient from a muscular standpoint while still remaining suboptimal in terms of overall effectiveness, particularly when aerodynamic resistance is considered.

This is precisely what scientific literature highlights.

## An evaluation that remains largely indirect

Research by Fonda and Sarabon (2010) has shown that postural changes simultaneously affect several dimensions of performance: mechanical efficiency, energy cost, and aerodynamic drag.

Yet these effects are not directly visible during a fitting session.

Similarly, Debraux et al. (2011) demonstrated that small variations in trunk angle can produce significant changes in drag coefficient without any perceptible change in pedaling motion.

Underwood et al. (2011) further note that fitting protocols still rely heavily on practitioner interpretation and that objective validation of positional adjustments on real-world performance remains limited.

The primary limitation of modern fitting is therefore not the lack of measurement tools, but the absence of indicators that directly link position to performance.

## Toward truly performance-oriented fitting

The evolution of bike fitting is not merely about increasing biomechanical measurement precision.

It represents a deeper shift: moving from a posture-adjustment approach to a comprehensive performance-analysis framework.

A position can no longer be evaluated solely based on stability or comfort. It must also be assessed according to its ability to enable effective power production and, above all, to convert that power into speed.

This is precisely what remains difficult to objectify today.

In this context, integrating indicators directly linked to speed represents one of the most transformative developments for the future of bike fitting.

## Aerodynamics: the missing variable in bike fitting

👉 Aerodynamics is today the only indicator directly connected to speed.

Yet this dimension remains rarely integrated into fitting sessions. Its evaluation historically required heavy infrastructure such as wind tunnels or complex field testing protocols, making it impractical for routine fitting practice.

The emergence of indoor aerodynamic analysis tools such as AeroX is now transforming this landscape.

AeroX enables real-time measurement of a cyclist’s frontal area and directly objectifies the aerodynamic efficiency of a position, adjustment after adjustment, within a fitting session itself.

For the first time, it becomes possible to concretely link a fitter’s positional changes to a measurable performance indicator.

This capability opens the path toward truly global fitting, seeking an individual optimum between comfort, power production, and aerodynamic efficiency.

Furthermore, aerodynamics is not a concern limited to elite or high-speed riders. As time-gain analyses show, relative performance gains are often even greater at moderate speeds than at very high speeds. This means aerodynamic optimization is relevant across all rider levels and therefore across the entire client base of bike fitters.

## Conclusion

Bike fitting has reached a high level of biomechanical sophistication.

Yet the real effectiveness of a position has long remained difficult to objectify due to the absence of indicators directly linking posture to performance.

The integration of aerodynamic measurement into fitting tools now marks a decisive step forward.

The future challenge of bike fitting is clear:

**to demonstrate that every positional adjustment truly makes the cyclist faster.**
