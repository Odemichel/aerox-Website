## Introduction  

In cycling and triathlon, every second matters.  
We train to produce more power, we refine our nutrition, we adjust our equipmentâ€¦ yet **aerodynamic position** often remains underestimated â€” or guessed at best.  

Why? Because itâ€™s invisible during training.  
You can feel your legs, see your power, hear your heart rate â€” but you canâ€™t feel your drag.  
Your muscles trick you into believing that pushing harder automatically means going faster.  

Thatâ€™s where **real-time feedback** changes everything.  
During indoor sessions on your smart trainer (Wahoo, Elite, Tacxâ€¦), it lets you connect every posture adjustment to its direct impact in km/h.  
In triathlon, this can mean **several minutes gained** on the bike leg â€” and in cycling, it can be the difference between a breakaway that makes it or being caught 500 meters before the finish.

## Why instant feedback accelerates learning  

Neuroscience has shown that the brain learns through **reinforcement**.  
Every attempt becomes an experiment â€” and the gap between what you expect and what you observe drives adaptation.  

- No feedback â†’ no correction â†’ your position stays random.  
- Delayed feedback â†’ partial learning, no reflex.  
- **Immediate feedback** â†’ the brain anchors the correct pattern.  

Itâ€™s the same logic as swim technique: the more immediate the coachâ€™s feedback, the faster the progress.  
If your coach only sees you once a month, errors persist.  

AeroX applies this same principle to **aerodynamic efficiency**.

## Aerodynamics â€” the invisible variable  

You can see your power.  
You can feel your heart rate.  
But **your aerodynamic drag?** Nothing.  

Outdoors, itâ€™s masked by wind, slope, and road surface.  
You might lose **2 to 3 km/h** without even realizing it.  

Yes, there are solutions â€” wind tunnels, velodrome testing, or sensor-based drag meters.  
But theyâ€™re expensive, time-limited, and give you **delayed or averaged feedback**.  

AeroX changes that.  
It measures your **frontal area (A)** in real time through your webcam and instantly shows how much every movement â€” lowering your head, narrowing your elbows â€” costs or saves you in speed.  

AeroX combines **visual feedback** (colors, gauges) with **quantitative feedback** (watts, km/h gains/losses).  
And most importantly, itâ€™s the first tool to offer **sensory feedback**: in *Speed Mode*, resistance automatically adapts to your position, so your body literally feels the cost of bad aerodynamics.  

A single session can already save you **1 to 2 minutes over 40 km** â€” the equivalent of several weeks of power training.

## From discovery to performance  

### 1. Explore  
In the first sessions, you test different positions, observe the results, and identify your most efficient setup.  

### 2. Integrate  
Over several workouts, you train to **hold that position** for 5â€“15 minute blocks at different intensities.  
This is where you learn to combine **power and aerodynamics**.  

### 3. Stabilize  
After a few weeks, the position becomes automatic.  
You can hold it even under fatigue â€” after 60 km in a breakaway or during a half-Ironman â€” and still start the run with energy left.

## Why a structured plan is essential  

Finding your optimal aero position is just the first step.  
To **keep your gains** in race conditions, you need to train your nervous system to make that position stable and repeatable.  

AeroX training plans include:  
- progressive **position-holding sessions**,  
- **power + aero combination** workouts,  
- full **race simulations** to validate stability over 40 km (or 90 km for a 70.3).  

The result: measurable, real-world gains â€” **minutes saved on the bike** without raising your FTP.

## Conclusion  

Real-time feedback is your best ally for intelligent progression.  
It reveals how your sensations have been misleading you, redefines your perception of effort, and turns a simple position test into a **lasting performance advantage**.  

A short AeroX session is enough to discover your optimal posture.  
But to save real minutes in your next triathlon or time trial, you must **repeat, stabilize, and automate** that position.  

ðŸ’¡ **Next step:**  
Plan a 4â€“6 week block focused on aero work.  
Combine power and aerodynamics until your position becomes second nature.  
And discover how much faster you can go â€” **without adding a single watt.**
