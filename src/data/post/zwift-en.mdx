## Introduction  

For more than a decade, **Zwift** has turned indoor cycling into a virtual playground.  
Itâ€™s the app that helped thousands of cyclists and triathletes stay motivated through winter, turning the trainer into a connected, social, and fun experience.  

With **AeroX**, the philosophy changes completely. Itâ€™s no longer about escaping into a virtual world â€” itâ€™s about **measuring reality â€” your reality**.  
AeroX transforms your **smart trainer** into a **virtual wind tunnel**, showing you in real time how your body position affects your aerodynamics and speed.  

Two worlds, two visions. Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve observed after using both side by side â€” and why AeroX is quickly becoming **the smartest Zwift alternative** for serious riders.

## Zwift: immersion and community  

Zwift is first and foremost a **cycling social network**.  
You can ride with thousands of connected cyclists, join group rides, race with live rankings, or simply chase down a passing avatar.  

The experience is **highly gamified**: badges to unlock, XP to gain, virtual gear to collect, hidden routes to discover. You quickly get hooked and keep coming back to level up.  

From structured workouts to training plans, Zwift offers **a complete environment for progression** â€” from beginner endurance sessions to advanced VOâ‚‚max intervals.  
You can create your own workouts, track power and heart rate data, but the **analysis remains quite basic**.  

The main limitation? **Position doesnâ€™t matter at all.**  
Whether you ride upright or in an aero position, **300 watts equals the same virtual speed**.  
Even worse â€” stop pedaling downhill and your avatar automatically goes into an aerodynamic tuck and speeds up.  
For those preparing a triathlon, riding solo, or trying to improve real performance, this lack of realism becomes a real issue.

## AeroX: realism, feedback, and aerodynamic awareness  

AeroX flips the script.  
Here, itâ€™s not about keeping you entertained â€” itâ€™s about **connecting you to the real physics of cycling**.  

As soon as you start pedaling, AeroX measures your **frontal area (A)** in real time using your webcam.  
That parameter â€” often ignored â€” determines your **aerodynamic drag**.  
AeroX uses physical models to show how every posture change affects your real speed based on your power output.  

Itâ€™s not a game â€” itâ€™s **scientific, real-time feedback**.  
You finally feel what aerodynamics really costsâ€¦ and what it gives back.  

### AeroX training modes  

- **Target Speed Mode** â€“ Your trainer automatically adjusts resistance to maintain a target speed based on your position. You instantly feel how posture affects performance.  
- **Free Simulation Mode (GPX)** â€“ Ride real-world routes. Your speed depends on power, slope, wind, and position. Train for your next Ironman, the Mont Ventoux, or any outdoor race with aerodynamic realism.  
- **Technique Mode** â€“ Compare different positions, test new setups, and immediately visualize the aerodynamic gains.  
- **Aero Time Trial Mode** â€“ Compete in races where victory depends on both power and aerodynamics â€” not just watts per kilo.  
- **Workout Builder** â€“ Create your own structured sessions or follow AeroXâ€™s progressive aero training plans.  

AeroX may not yet have Zwiftâ€™s massive community â€” thatâ€™s the price of innovation.  
But it brings what Zwift never offered: the **democratization of aerodynamics** and the ability to turn every watt into real speed.  

For cyclists and triathletes who care about efficiency, AeroX is more than a training tool â€” itâ€™s a step into the future of indoor cycling.
