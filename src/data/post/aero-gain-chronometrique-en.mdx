## Introduction

Many cyclists think:

**“Aerodynamics is for the pros.”**  
**“Below 40 km/h, it doesn’t make much difference.”**

That’s wrong.

The laws of physics are identical for everyone.  
And in reality, aerodynamics can represent **a much more decisive time-saving lever for amateurs** than for professionals.

Let us explain.

## What physics tells us

From around 15 km/h, aerodynamic drag already represents more than 50% of the total resistances opposing a cyclist on flat terrain.

In other words:  
Even at “moderate” speed, **air is already your main opponent**.

---

## The misinterpretation

We often hear:

**“Pros ride faster, so aerodynamics matters more for them.”**

That is partially true… but incomplete.

The reality is that when aerodynamic drag is reduced by 10%, the power saved is also close to 10% as early as 20 km/h. This leads to a speed increase of around 3% at constant power.  
This reality is true for everyone.

Concretely, that means going from 40 km/h to 41.2 km/h, and from 20 km/h to 20.6 km/h.

So yes, the faster you ride, the greater the impact aerodynamics has on your speedometer. And gaining a few tenths of km/h may seem negligible at first glance…

And this is where a huge misunderstanding causes amateurs to lose a lot of time on their results…

👉 **Let’s talk about time gains**

When you ride at 40 km/h, 1 km takes 1 minute 30 seconds. At 41.2 km/h, it takes 1 minute 27 seconds.

When you ride at 20 km/h, 1 km takes 3 minutes. At 20.6 km/h, it takes 2 minutes 55 seconds.

In other words, when a fast cyclist improves aerodynamics by 10%, that’s 3 seconds gained per km. For the amateur riding half as fast, that’s more than 5 seconds gained per km!!!

**Amateurs therefore have much more to gain on their overall times by optimizing their aerodynamics.**

The image above shows the gains you can target when moving from an upright position to an optimized aerodynamic position on a road bike or on a time trial (or triathlon) bike.
And yes, your position can help you gain up to 20 seconds per kilometer when riding at 20 km/h…
The effect is amplified over long distances, and on an Ironman (180 km), the impact becomes even more spectacular. When an amateur is aiming to beat cut-off times, position therefore becomes crucial.

## Concrete example: 40 km

Let’s imagine two cyclists who both improve their aerodynamics by 10%. One initially rides at 45 km/h, the other at 32 km/h.

Estimated gain:

- At 45 km/h → about **1 minute 40 seconds** over 40 km  
- At 32 km/h → about **2 minutes 20 seconds** over 40 km  

The time gain is therefore **always greater for the slower cyclist**. 

## What this changes strategically

For an amateur:

- Increasing FTP by 20 watts requires months of training.
- Reducing CdA by 8 to 12% can be achieved in a few weeks.

And above all:

👉 **Position is a free lever.**

No need to buy a $10,000 bike.  
No need for exotic sensors.

It is about learning to:

- **Optimize your position**
- **Hold that position**
- **Be powerful in that position**

## Why this lever is underused

Three main reasons:

1. Lack of real-time feedback  
2. Difficulty in feeling aerodynamic drag  
3. Excessive focus on power  

Power is visible.  
Aerodynamics is invisible. But AeroX definitively changes that !

Therefore, it is neglected.

## Conclusion

Aerodynamics is not reserved for elites.

It is even **more profitable for amateurs**.

The real question is not:

**“Do I ride fast enough for aerodynamics to matter?”**

But rather:

**“How many minutes am I willing to leave on the road?”**
