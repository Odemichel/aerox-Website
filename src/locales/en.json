  "ourStory.meta.description": "The story behind AeroX — the virtual wind tunnel for cyclists and triathletes. Born from a real training need: optimize your aero on a smart trainer, ride faster, save watts.",
  "ourStory.hero.tagline": "Our story",
  "ourStory.hero.title": "AeroX: from pain point to breakthrough",
  "ourStory.hero.subtitle": "A triathlon problem turned into a tool any cyclist can use",
  "ourStory.h2": "How AeroX began",
  "ourStory.p1": "It started with long hours on a <strong>smart trainer</strong>. Power up, numbers up… then race day: climbing, I caught riders; on the flat, I got dropped. The reason? <strong>Aerodynamics</strong> — the invisible drag that’s ~70&nbsp;% of resistance at 25&nbsp;km/h and up to 95&nbsp;% at high speed.",
  "ourStory.p2": "Like many, I thought higher Zwift watts meant real progress. I wasn’t training my aero position. Outside, I held it for minutes at best. I blamed bikes and wheels… until my CNRS background reminded me: <strong>~80&nbsp;% of aero losses come from the rider, not the gear</strong>. The real brake was me.",
  "ourStory.p3": "Feel can fool you. Pushing harder isn’t the answer. A raised head or wide aerobars can cost dozens of watts and several km/h. Indoors, nothing forces you to learn or correct your posture. Worse, Zwift tucks your avatar downhill when you stop pedaling — misleading. Result: zero feedback. Zero constraints. Zero lasting progress.",
  "ourStory.p4": "Out of that frustration came <span class=\"text-primary\"><span class=\"font-bold\">AeroX</span>: an app that <em>turns your smart trainer into a virtual wind tunnel</em></span>. With just a webcam, you see in real time how position changes affect speed. You save watts and go faster — like a pro wind tunnel at €1800/day — but from your living room, for the price of a coffee a day.",
  "ourStory.p5": "From the first tests, it was clear: narrower aerobars, head tucked, position held — I gained 3&nbsp;km/h in races. Beyond a personal tool, AeroX lets <strong>thousands of cyclists and triathletes</strong> learn aero, measure it, feel it, and finally train smart so every watt turns into speed.",

  "home.faq.items.1.title": "Why AeroX?",
  "home.faq.items.1.education": "From 25 km/h, aerodynamics is 70–95% of what slows you down. Without data, we just push harder. AeroX shows other, smarter levers. After that, you won’t be able to say: I didn’t know.",

  "home.faq.items.2.title": "What gear do I need?",
  "home.faq.items.2.education": "A smart trainer (Bluetooth FTMS), your bike, a computer (macOS or Windows) and a webcam — laptop cam, smartphone or USB webcam.",
  "home.faq.items.2.more": "A computer, your smart trainer, a camera",

  "home.faq.items.3.title": "How long does setup take?",
  "home.faq.items.3.education": "Place the camera, calibrate in two clicks — you’re ready for real-time aero feedback.",
  "home.faq.items.3.more": "In under 2 minutes, your trainer becomes a virtual wind tunnel…",

  "home.faq.items.4.title": "Is my trainer or sensor compatible with AeroX?",
  "home.faq.items.4.education": "Yes. AeroX works with most smart trainers (Wahoo, Elite, Tacx, Saris, etc.). macOS and Windows available now; tablets in development. If your trainer isn’t interactive, use analysis mode (visual feedback without resistance control).",
  "home.faq.items.4.more": "Compatible with 95% of smart trainers — probably yours…",

  "home.faq.items.5.title": "Innovation or gadget?",
  "home.faq.items.5.education": "Built by a CNRS researcher and triathlete, AeroX gives you concrete aero feedback — like HR monitors did 20 years ago. Training without HR or power sensors seems unthinkable today. Tomorrow, add aero.",

  "home.faq.items.6.title": "I ride in a bunch — is this still useful?",
  "home.faq.items.6.education": "Cycling isn’t just sitting in the bunch. Echelons, breakaways, pulling — aero makes the difference. With +3 km/h, you might enjoy attacking.",
  "home.faq.items.6.more": "Yes — unless you plan to stay at the back!",

  "home.faq.items.7.title": "Do I need a subscription to find and test my optimal position?",
  "home.faq.items.7.education": "You can test on day one, free. The subscription turns that position into a solid habit — your sixth sense outdoors.",
  "home.faq.items.7.more": "Test with the free plan, progress with a subscription",

  "home.faq.items.8.title": "I’m already used to an aero position — is this still useful?",
